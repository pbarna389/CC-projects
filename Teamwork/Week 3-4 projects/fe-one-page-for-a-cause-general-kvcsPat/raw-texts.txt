WELCOME section:

Welcome to Befogad-LAK animal rescue foundation
A second chance for orphaned dogs in need.



WHAT ARE WE DOING section:

The primary goal of the Foundation is to promote animal welfare,
to emphasize the importance of spaying and neutering, and to
educate people about responsible animal husbandry. It also aims
to find the owners of unmarked stray dogs and, if this does not
prove successful, to arrange for their temporary care by a
veterinarian and then to find a permanent owner.

ABOUT section:

Befogad-LAK is an animal rescue foundation in Hungary – it’s leader (and only member at the moment) is Gabriella Mittó. The foundation
started it’s activity back at 2016, and since then, it has been rescued more than a hundred dogs and a handful of cats.

The foundation puts a lot of effort into spreading information to owners about responsible animal keeping (like creating the best
environment for animals, feeding etc.), rescuing homeless/abandoned animals, pay for these sheltered animal’s ovariohysterectomy
and chip them, and find home for these animals.

To adapt an animal, you have to pay for the first medical expense related
to the animal, or pay 15.000 HUF to the foundation. At the moment, there
are ten dogs available for adaptation but all of their cat’s found their home
at responsible owners.

The foundation also makes memoirs for their lost sheltered animals.
